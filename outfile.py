Our idea was to make the features of smartphones more accessible by developing a simpler form of reading and writing in braille. There's a lot of work left to be done before the full potential of the idea can be realized, but I've been beyond amazed by the support and recognition our team has gotten thus far, including the PennApps Grand Prize and Best Hardware Hack awards from PennApps and AlphaLab Gear. I'm not sure what lies ahead, but I'm incredibly grateful to the PennApps team, my fellow teammates and everyone else who made this hackathon and our project possible and I'm blessed to be in a position where I can do what I love while working towards a better future.\n\n*insert expression of extreme delight here*", 'fbid': u'1053276704717177_10153596987386649', u'story': u"Cyrus Tabrizi shared PennApps's photo.", u'object_id': u'947289225328711'}
